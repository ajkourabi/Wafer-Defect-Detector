# Wafer Defect Detector
 I built a CNN using Keras-Tuner to detect defetcs in silicon wafers. Keras-Tuner is a function within the TensorFlow library that automated the selection of the amount of layers, filters, dropout layers, pool sizes, etc. 

My main goal was to get a very high F1 Score, as that combines both recall and precision.
